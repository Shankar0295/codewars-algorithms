            In this example you have to validate if a user input string is alphanumeric. The given string is not nil/null/NULL/None, so you don't have to check that.
            The string has the following conditions to be alphanumeric:
            At least one character ("" is not valid)
            Allowed characters are uppercase / lowercase latin letters and digits from 0 to 9
            No whitespaces / underscore
